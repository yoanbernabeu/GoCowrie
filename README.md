# GoCowrie CLI - Experimental

GoCowrie is an interactive CLI tool designed to help you quickly and efficiently navigate [Cowrie honeypot](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie) JSON logs. With two screens for navigation, you can easily browse source IPs and drill down into detailed event lists.

## How to Use

1. **Run the CLI**:
   ```bash
   go run main.go /path/to/cowrie.json
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/cowrie.json` with the actual path to your Cowrie logs file.

2. **Main Screen**:
   - On startup, you will see a table listing unique source IPs.
   - For each IP, you can see:
     - **First Event Timestamp**
     - **Last Event Timestamp**
     - **Login Success?** (Indicates if a `cowrie.login.success` event occurred)
   
   **Keyboard Controls**:
   - **Up/Down Arrows**: Move the selection between different IP rows.
   - **Enter**: Open the detail screen for the currently selected IP.
   - **Esc**: Exit the application.

3. **Detail Screen**:
   - After pressing Enter on the selected IP, you will see a new table showing all events related to that IP.
   - Columns include:
     - Timestamp
     - Event ID
     - Username/Password (if any)
     - Input Command (if any)
     - Message
   
   **Keyboard Controls**:
   - **Up/Down/Left/Right Arrows**: Scroll through the events if the list is long.
   - **Esc**: Return to the main screen.

4. **Exiting the CLI**:
   - To quit, press **Esc** from the main screen.

## Tips

- Ensure that your Cowrie log file is in JSON format, one event per line.
- Use arrow keys to navigate quickly between rows and columns.
- If the event lists are very long, utilize the scroll functionality by pressing arrow keys in the detail screen.
- Pressing **Esc** from the detail screen takes you back to the main screen without losing your place.

## Example

```bash
go run main.go cowrie.json
```

1. On the main screen, use **Down Arrow** to select an IP.
2. Press **Enter** to view that IPâ€™s events.
3. Navigate through the events with arrow keys.
4. Press **Esc** to go back to the main screen and **Esc** again to exit completely.
